# Conways-Game-of-Life
This is my version of Conways Game of Life. This was done with Java and JavaFX this summer whilst working my two jobs. Its a very simple program and didnt take much working hours. Still a super cool program, I have aways loved the complexity within the simplicity of Conways Game of Life so it was really cool to get to implement my own.
