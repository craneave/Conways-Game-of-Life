# Conways-Game-of-Life
This is my version of Conway's Game of Life. This was done with Java and JavaFX this summer whilst working my two jobs. It's a very simple program and did not take many working hours. Still a super cool program, I have always loved the complexity within the simplicity of Conway's Game of Life so it was really cool to get to implement my own.
