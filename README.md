# Conways-Game-of-Life
This is my version of Conway's Game of Life. This was done with Java and JavaFX a long time ago, like 5-6 years ago maybe. It's a simple program and did not take many working hours. Still a super cool program, so I wanted to upload it here because why not I have always loved the complexity within the simplicity of Conway's Game of Life so it was cool to get to implement my own. Users can click to put their cells down, they also can randomize them, along with clear, and start/stop the algorithm.
